Users of the api.mercurylayer.com blind key service should carefully read the terms of use detailed below. By completing token_init with the supplied token_id or accessing our services a User agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use. These Terms of User are not assignable by the user to anyone else.

Mercury layer is an implementation of a system the uses a blind co-signing and key-update service that enables statechains. 
The Mercury blind key service generates and updates key shares (or key fragments) on request in addition to a count of partial blinded signatures. The blind key-update server never has control or custody, and is never aware of the identity of any shared key.

Mercury layer service
The mercury layer service generates a private key share s1 on initialisation of a session. In order to initialise a session, a client must provide a valid token_id which controls access to the service.

The client then initialises a session with an auth_pubkey which is used to authenticate all subsequent messages with the server. The server responds with the public elliptic curve point corresponding to the session private key share s1.

Once initialised, the server can then perform two operations using the key share:

Partial signature generation - the server uses the key share to compute a partial signature from a blinded challenge value provided by the client.
Key update - an encrypted value is sent to the server and used to update the key share along with a new auth_pubkey for the updated key. The previous key share is then deleted securely.
The server does not ever receive any other information regarding the client state.

Token ID Generation:

Valid Token IDs (token_id) can be generated by first initialising a token_id (GET api.mercurylayer.com/token/token_gen) and then agreeing to the terms of use (GET api.mercurylayer.com/token/token_init/<token_id>). 
This returns a JSON object that specifies an amount (in EUR) required to be paid in BTC via a Lightning invoice or on-chain. The JSON object contains the invoice and swiss-bitcoin-pay.ch invoice ID (the invoice can be viewed at api.swiss-bitcoin-pay.ch/checkout/<processor_id>). 
Once the invoice has been paid (via the Lightning Network or on-chain) the token_id is verified (GET api.mercurylayer.com/token/token_verify/<token_id>). 
The token_id is now valid and can be used to generate a blind key share 'session' (see docs.mercurylayer.com for API details). 

The 'session' will maintain the key share privately for a period of 12 months, or until the session is closed by the user. 
The session will enable the generation of up to 10,000 blind partial signatures and up to 10,000 key update operations.
